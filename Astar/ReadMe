In this project, I have implemented Astar on the following-
1) Astar on project2 obstacle space
2) Astar on RRl environment 2d obstacle space without differential constraints
3) Astar with Vrep simulation
4) Astar with differential constraints

Each folder has its own read me for instructions.

Output:
1)Outputs text files are included in output folder of Astar-vrep and Astar-with-differential-constraints
2)Output images and screenshots are also provided for every code in their respective folder
