A-star Vrep Simulation without Differential Constraints 

How to run code:
1)Run Vrep 
2)Open rrlideal_final.ttt map from map folder
3)Start the simulation in Vrep
4)Run vrep_connect.m
5)Select Goal Point 
-- Watch the video -Test with explanation - i have explained the process of running the code

To change the resolution modify the res parameter
To see the nodes generated, uncomment the plot lines in turtlebot_atar function in all actions

Output-

The output text file iis generated using the graph from vrep simulation
I have included the screenshots of the vrep simulation while i was generating the data for velocity
The data is then exported in csv format, from which i extracted the velocities
The frequency is 20Hz while extracting data. I have skipped some values and also provided the 2hz file in the output folder.
